# SmartSolarProject
This is a project from the (Tauranga Web Meetup group) [http://www.meetup.com/TaurangaWeb/]
We're using it mainly as a learning and communications project, and as a good reason to actually have our monthly meetups =)
Aside from that purpose, it is also intended to be actually useful - it will allow the control of a Solar Water Heater to minimise electricity costs.

## GitHub organisation
This is the master repo, which holds overall documentation and issues.
The actual code has been divided into 3 separate projects, which are being worked on by different groups within the meetup:

* [SmartSolarDevice](https://github.com/codevelopnz/SmartSolarDevice) is the bit that runs on the Raspberry Pi
* [SmartSolarService](https://github.com/codevelopnz/SmartSolarService) is the bit that runs in the cloud
* [SmartSolarMobile](https://github.com/codevelopnz/SmartSolarService) is the bit that runs on a mobile phone

Workflow: work should be done in your own fork of these projects. When you've done something cool in your fork, submit a pull request and we'll review and pull it in at a Meetup. This helps ensure everyone knows what is happening, and provides a great time to share learnings with the team.
In the unlikely event that you're not a Tauranga Web Meetup member but you still want to work on this - go ahead, we'll still action your pull requests and maybe skype you into the meeting if you'd like.
